中文：这个软件运行后能悬浮在所有软件之上，可以自动控制安卓系统下安装的微信，对指定微信发的每个语音进行录制后转发到指定的微信群，全程自动化，减少人工成本，当然这个软件是我很多年前（约2016年）自己开发的，现在的安卓系统和微信早就更新了不知道多少版了，所以现在应该是不能控制的，不过原理是类似的，改改应该也还可以用，这个软件在稳定性方面使用了自驱式的原理，可以说是现代人工智能的起源之一。软件原理：软件采用自驱式推进软件往前运行，通过不断截取屏幕图片，跟预置的需要识别的界面数据和需要点击的按钮图片数据进行比对（这个比对包括对图形的二值化，异化，比对等等），然后进行相关操作。多年后的今天，我发现这种自动化操作居然发展出了一个行业：RPA机器人。所以这个软件我觉得你可以看成是一个RPA机器人，这个机器人运行在安卓下对窗体应用进行自动化操作。这个软件是我很多年前自己开发的，现在把源代码公开出来，由于暂时没有时间，所以直接公开，未做代码调整和优化，希望对技术传播有所助益。本代码公开纯属技术交流，没有收取任何费用，软件使用android studio开发。 English:After running, this software can be suspended on all the software. It can automatically control the wechat installed under the Android system, record and forward each voice sent by the designated wechat group to the designated wechat group, and the whole process is automated to reduce labor costs. Of course, this software was developed by myself many years ago (about 2016). Now the Android system and wechat have been updated for a long time. I don't know how many versions, so it should be uncontrollable now, However, the principle is similar, and the modification should also be used. This software uses the self driving principle in terms of stability, which can be said to be one of the origins of modern artificial intelligence. Software principle: the software uses self driving to push the software forward. By constantly intercepting screen images, it compares with the preset interface data that needs to be identified and the button image data that needs to be clicked (this comparison includes binarization, alienation, comparison, etc. of graphics), and then carries out relevant operations. Today, many years later, I found that this kind of automation has developed an industry: RPA robot. So I think you can think of this software as an RPA robot, which runs under Android to automate window applications. This software was developed by myself many years ago, and now the source code is published. Because I don't have time for the time being, it is directly published without code adjustment and optimization. I hope it will be helpful to the spread of technology. The disclosure of this code is purely technical exchange, and no fee is charged. The software is developed using Android studio.
